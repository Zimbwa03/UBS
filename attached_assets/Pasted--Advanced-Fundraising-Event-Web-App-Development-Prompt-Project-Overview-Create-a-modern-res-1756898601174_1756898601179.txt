# Advanced Fundraising Event Web App Development Prompt

## Project Overview
Create a modern, responsive fundraising event web application that serves as both a marketing platform and real-time donation tracker. The app should encourage continuous engagement through dynamic visual feedback and real-time progress updates.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Marketing & Event Information
- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching banner with event title, compelling tagline, and call-to-action
- **Event Details**: Date, time, location, purpose, and impact statement
- **Story Section**: Emotional narrative explaining why donations matter
- **Gallery**: Photos/videos showcasing the cause or previous events
- **Testimonials**: Supporter quotes and success stories
- **Contact Information**: Organization details and social media links

### 2. Real-Time Donation Tracking System
- **Dynamic Progress Bar**: 
  - Animated, stylish progress visualization
  - Shows current amount vs. target goal
  - Percentage completion display
  - Smooth animations when updated
  - Color-coded (e.g., red → yellow → green based on progress)
- **Live Statistics Dashboard**:
  - Total amount raised
  - Number of donors
  - Amount remaining to goal
  - Average donation amount
  - Recent donation activity feed
- **Milestone Indicators**: Visual markers for fundraising milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Countdown Timer**: Time remaining for the fundraising campaign

### 3. Supabase Integration Requirements
- **Real-time Database**: Set up Supabase table for donations with fields:
  - donation_id, donor_name, amount, timestamp, message, is_anonymous
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Implement Supabase real-time listeners for instant updates
- **Data Security**: Proper row-level security policies
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for donation submission and retrieval

### 4. Technical Specifications

#### Frontend Framework
- Use React with modern hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Implement Supabase JavaScript client for real-time functionality
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS or styled-components
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for mobile optimization

#### UI/UX Design Requirements
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional aesthetic with consistent branding
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, proper ARIA labels
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive across all devices
- **Performance**: Fast loading times, optimized images and assets
- **Animations**: Subtle micro-interactions and smooth transitions
- **Color Psychology**: Use trust-building colors (blues, greens) with accent colors for CTAs

#### Advanced Progress Visualization
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Progress bars, circular progress, thermometer-style indicators
- **Animation Library**: Use Framer Motion or similar for smooth animations
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant visual feedback when new donations arrive
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, clickable progress segments
- **Goal Achievement Celebration**: Confetti or celebration animation when target is reached

### 5. Key Features to Implement

#### Donation Interface
- Simple, secure donation form
- Multiple payment amount options
- Custom amount input
- Donor name and message fields
- Anonymous donation option
- Payment gateway integration placeholder

#### Social Features
- **Social Sharing**: Pre-populated social media sharing buttons
- **Leaderboard**: Top donors (with permission)
- **Recent Activity**: Live feed of recent donations
- **Impact Calculator**: Show what specific amounts can achieve

#### Engagement Tools
- **Email Newsletter Signup**: Capture leads for future campaigns
- **Volunteer Registration**: Allow people to offer time instead of money
- **Event Reminders**: Calendar integration
- **Push Notifications**: For mobile users (PWA)

### 6. Data Management

#### Supabase Schema
```sql
-- Donations table
CREATE TABLE donations (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  donor_name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  is_anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Campaign settings table
CREATE TABLE campaign_settings (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  target_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  campaign_title TEXT NOT NULL,
  end_date TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

#### Real-time Functionality
- Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant updates
- Handle connection states and offline scenarios
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

### 7. Performance & Security

#### Optimization
- Lazy loading for images and components
- Debounced API calls
- Caching strategies for static content
- Code splitting for faster initial load

#### Security Measures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for donation submissions
- HTTPS enforcement
- Environment variable management for API keys

### 8. Additional Enhancement Ideas

#### Gamification Elements
- Donation streaks and badges
- Progress milestone celebrations
- Donor recognition levels
- Team fundraising competitions

#### Analytics & Reporting
- Donation patterns and trends
- Geographic distribution of donors
- Campaign performance metrics
- Export capabilities for reporting

#### Advanced UI Components
